= Storing data with data connections

For this {deliverable}, you need two S3-compatible object storage buckets, such as Ceph, Minio, or AWS S3:

* *My Storage* - Use this bucket for storing your models and data. You can reuse this bucket and its connection for your notebooks and model servers.
*  *Pipelines Artifacts* - Use this bucket as storage for your pipeline artifacts. A pipeline artifacts bucket is required when you create a pipeline server. For this {deliverable}, create this bucket to separate it from the first storage bucket for clarity.

You can use your own storage buckets or run a provided script that creates local Minio storage buckets for you.

Also, you must create a data connection to each storage bucket. A data connection is a resource that contains the configuration parameters needed to connect to an object storage bucket.

You have two options for this {deliverable}, depending on whether you want to use your own storage buckets or use a script to create local Minio storage buckets:

* If you want to use your own S3-compatible object storage buckets, create data connections to them as described in xref:creating-data-connections-to-storage.adoc[Creating data connections to your own S3-compatible object storage].

* If you want to run a script that installs local Minio storage buckets and creates data connections to them, for the purposes of this {deliverable}, follow the steps in xref:running-a-script-to-install-storage.adoc[Running a script to install local object storage buckets and create data connections].
